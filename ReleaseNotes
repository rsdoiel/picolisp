         Release Notes for picoLisp-3.0.3
         ================================

A. The underlined display of transient symbols in the documentation is changed
   back to double quotes, to allow an easier copy/paste of example code
   fragments.

B. The function 'not' is included in the group of flow- and logic-functions
   which store non-NIL results of their conditional expressions in '@' (see the
   chapter "@ Result" in "doc/ref.html"). This makes it consistent with 'nand'
   and 'nor'.

C. The line editor "lib/led.l" cycles with TAB also through path names (in
   addition to internal symbols).
