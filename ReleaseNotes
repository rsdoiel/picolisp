         Release Notes for picoLisp-3.0.7
         ================================

1. Runtime files, like the line editor history and temporary directories, were
   moved to a ".pil/" directory in the user's home directory. The reason is that
   for a global installation of PicoLisp, neither the installation directory nor
   the current working directory can be assumed to be writable.

   The line editor history used to reside in the installation directory, in the
   file "@.picoHistory". It is now in "~/.pil/history".

   Temporary directories (with the PID as name) were created in a "tmp/"
   directory in the current working directory. They are now in "~/.pil/tmp/".

2. A preliminary implementation of the 64-bit version for PowerPC (ppc64).
   Doesn't run yet, but will hopefully improve until this release is due.
