         Release Notes for picoLisp-3.0.3
         ================================

A. The underlined display of transient symbols in the documentation is changed
   back to double quotes, to allow an easier copy/paste of example code
   fragments.

B. The function 'not' is included in the group of flow- and logic-functions
   which store non-NIL results of their conditional expressions in '@' (see the
   chapter "@ Result" in "doc/ref.html"). This makes it consistent with 'nand'
   and 'nor'.

C. The line editor "lib/led.l" cycles with TAB also through path names (in
   addition to internal symbols).

D. The 'format' number <-> string conversion function now also accepts a list
   argument. This is like as if 'pack' were built-in. Where

      (format (pack Lst))

   had to be written, now

      (format Lst)

   will also do.

E. PicoLisp now supports coroutines (multiple independent execution contexts),
   though only in the 64-bit version. More about that in
   "doc/ref.html#coroutines".

F. The stack is now checked at runtime (also only in the 64-bit version). This
   became necessary because coroutines require separate stack segments. Until
   now (and still in the 32-bit version) the stack could grow until the
   operating system sent a segmentation violation signal. With the stack checks,
   a controlled error handler is entered upon stack overflow. The stack segment
   size can be manipulated with the new 'stack' function.
