         Release Notes for picoLisp-3.0.3
         ================================

A. The underlined display of transient symbols in the documentation is changed
   back to double quotes, to allow an easier copy/paste of example code
   fragments.

B. The function 'not' is included in the group of flow- and logic-functions
   which store non-NIL results of their conditional expressions in '@' (see the
   chapter "@ Result" in "doc/ref.html"). This makes it consistent with 'nand'
   and 'nor'.

C. The line editor "lib/led.l" cycles with TAB also through path names (in
   addition to internal symbols).

D. The 'format' number <-> string conversion function now also accepts a list
   argument. This is like as if 'pack' were built-in. Where

      (format (pack Lst))

   had to be written, now

      (format Lst)

   will also do.

E. There is a partially implemented 32-bit emulator of the 64-bit version in
   "src64/arch/x86-32.l". It is intended as a demonstration of how to port the
   assembler to a different CPU (not a very suitable demonstration, though), and
   a way to thest 64-bit programs on a 32-bit machine. If it ever works, it will
   be deadly slow, though.

   In case somebody likes to grit his teeth on it, an exprimental executable
   "bin/emu32" can be built with

      (cd src64; ./mkEmu32)

   Be warned, however, it builds something which doesn't run. Most instructions
   that return CPU flags, and 128-bit multiplication/division are not right yet.
   Besides this, there are probably a lot of bugs.
