         Release Notes for picoLisp-3.0.4
         ================================

A. In the 64-bit version bignum division is now faster by a factor between 20
   and 60. That version had used an inefficient algorithm (bitwise shifts),
   which was now replaced by Knuth's wordwise division algorithm (as is used
   32-bit version).

B. An OpenGL library (64-bit) is now part of the standard release.
