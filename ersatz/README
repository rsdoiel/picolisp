         Ersatz PicoLisp
         ===============

Ersatz PicoLisp is a version of PicoLisp completely written in Java. It requires
a 1.6 Java Runtime Environment.

It should be the last resort when there is no other way to run a "real"
PicoLisp. Also, it may be used to bootstrap the 64-bit version, which requires a
running PicoLisp to build from the sources.

Performance is rather poor. It is 5 to 10 times slower, allocates a huge amount
of memory at startup (600 MB vs. 3 MB), and needs 2.5 to 4 times the space for
runtime Lisp data. But efficiency was not a major goal. Instead, performance was
often sacrificed in favor of simpler or more modular structures.

There is no support for

- raw console inpt ('key') and line editing
- child processes ('fork')
- interprocess communication ('tell', 'hear', 'ipc', 'udp' etc.)
- databases (external symbols)
- signal handling


      Invocation
      ----------

Ersatz PicoLisp can be started - analog to 'bin/picolisp' - as

   $ ersatz/picolisp

This already includes slighly simplfied versions of the standard libraries as
loaded by 'dbg' (without database support, but with Pilog and XML support).


      Building the JAR file
      ---------------------

The actual source files are

   sys.src  # The system
   fun.src  # Function definitions

The PicoLisp script "mkJar" will read them, generate the Java source file
"PicoLisp.java", compile that with 'javac', and pack the result into a JAR (Java
Archive) file. "mkJar" expects to be run in the "ersatz/" directory, e.g.:

   $ (cd ersatz; ./mkJar)
